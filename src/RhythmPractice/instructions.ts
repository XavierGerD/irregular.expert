  `This app allows you to practice all types of regular and irregular
    rhythmic groups, as well as alternating between different values. It
    works by randomly generating an endless number of rhythmic figures.
    Simply start the app and clap your hands or follow along with your
    instrument. The value in the first bar is to be played as many times
    as the rep number. The second bar is provided for ease of reading.`,
