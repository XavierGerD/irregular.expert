irregular.expert is a small browser-based app designed to be a toolkit for musicians.

Its main function is Rhythm, a Javascript app that randomly generates rhythmic figures in the form of bars or tuplets. Using the SMuFL standard, musical notation is displayed to the user while a metronome ticks. The user must then clap their hands to the displayed rhythmic figure.

The second function is Drone, an app that uses the Tone.JS library. Its purpose is to allow musicians, particularily string players, to practice intonation by generating drones. The looper mode allows users to schedule changes in drones to practice passages with changing harmony.
